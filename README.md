# Running HPC Sytems On Red Hat Openshift

### Containerizing MPI Applications
Building MPI-aware Containers: Discuss the technical specifics of embedding MPI libraries within containers, ensuring compatibility with host MPI versions and container orchestration.
Shared Memory Optimizations: Address the use of shared memory (e.g., IPC namespaces) for performance in multi-process MPI applications within a single node.

### Node and Cluster Configuration for HPC
CPU and Memory Affinity: Get into the technicalities of configuring CPU and memory affinity for MPI processes to optimize cache and memory access patterns.
GPU Utilization: If relevant, detail the configuration for GPU-accelerated computing, including the use of NVIDIA GPU Operator and CUDA-aware MPI.

### Advanced Networking for MPI in OpenShift
RDMA and High-speed Networking: Delve into setting up RDMA (Remote Direct Memory Access) and high-speed networking for MPI on OpenShift, which might include working with SR-IOV, RoCE, or InfiniBand.
Multi-networking and Network Customization: Discuss how to use Kubernetes CNI (Container Network Interface) plugins to enable advanced networking features necessary for high-performance MPI communication.

### Job Scheduling and Orchestration
MPI Job Launcher Integration: Explain integrating MPI job launchers with OpenShift workload controllers like Jobs or CronJobs, including the technicalities of handling parallel job launches across multiple nodes/pods.
Advanced Scheduling Features: Detail how to use Kubernetes' advanced scheduling features like taints, tolerations, and affinity/anti-affinity rules to optimize the placement of MPI workloads.

### Emulating HPC-Specific Features in OpenShift
- Advanced Resource Management
  - Resource Overcommit and Backfill Scheduling: In traditional HPC, overcommitting resources and backfill scheduling are common. In OpenShift, this can be emulated using Kubernetes Quality of Service (QoS) classes and priorities to allow for resource overcommitment. Implement a strategy where less critical jobs can yield resources to higher priority tasks.

  - Node Packing Strategies: Implement node packing strategies using pod affinity and anti-affinity rules. This can help in optimizing resource usage, similar to how HPC systems try to pack jobs to maximize node utilization.

- Workload Management

  - Workload Partitioning: Discuss setting up workload partitioning using node selectors and labels. This is akin to HPC systems where jobs are directed to nodes based on their hardware or software characteristics.

  - Dynamic Workload Balancing: In HPC systems, dynamic workload balancing is critical. In OpenShift, this can be partially achieved by autoscaling pods and nodes based on the workload demands.

- Checkpoint/Restart Mechanisms
  - Implementing Checkpoint/Restart: Traditional HPC systems often use checkpoint/restart mechanisms for long-running jobs. In OpenShift, explore integrating solutions like CRIU (Checkpoint/Restore in Userspace) for container checkpointing and restoration.

- Specialized Hardware Utilization
  - FPGA and GPU Scheduling: Beyond GPU scheduling, detail how to schedule jobs requiring other specialized hardware like FPGAs (Field Programmable Gate Arrays), which are increasingly used in HPC scenarios.

- Interconnect and Topology Awareness
  - Topology-Aware Scheduling: Discuss how to implement topology-aware scheduling in OpenShift, where the scheduler is aware of the node topology (NUMA nodes, GPUs, network interfaces) to optimize the placement of MPI workloads.

- Job Dependency Management
  - Handling Job Dependencies: HPC systems often handle complex job dependencies. Explain how to manage job dependencies in OpenShift, potentially using workflow orchestration tools like Argo or Apache Airflow.

- Elastic and Spot Workloads
  - Handling Elastic and Spot Instances: Discuss the management of elastic and spot workloads, which is especially relevant in cloud-based OpenShift clusters where spot instances can be used for cost-effective resource scaling.

- Custom Scheduler Integration
  - Integrating Custom Schedulers: For advanced scheduling needs that mirror HPC systems more closely, discuss the possibility of integrating custom schedulers with OpenShift.

- Performance Isolation
  - Ensuring Performance Isolation: Address how to isolate performance-critical workloads to prevent interference from other less critical workloads, similar to how HPC systems often provide dedicated resources for high-priority jobs.

### Storage Optimization for HPC
High-throughput File Systems: Discuss the integration and optimization of high-throughput file systems (like Lustre or GPFS) in OpenShift, focusing on the specifics of persistent volume setup and performance considerations.

### Performance Monitoring and Tuning
HPC-specific Metrics and Monitoring: Dive into performance metrics relevant to HPC applications (like MPI communication patterns, memory bandwidth usage, CPU cycle details) and how to effectively monitor these within OpenShift.
Profiling and Tuning MPI Applications: Provide guidance on profiling MPI applications within containers and tuning parameters (both at the MPI library and OpenShift levels) for optimal performance.

### Security Considerations in HPC on OpenShift
Network Security in Multi-tenant Environments: Address the complexities of ensuring network security in a multi-tenant OpenShift environment, especially when dealing with high-speed, low-latency networks.
Container Security Best Practices: Delve into security best practices specific to containers running sensitive HPC workloads.

### Handling Specific HPC Workloads
Workload-specific Considerations: Discuss considerations for different types of HPC workloads (e.g., CFD simulations vs. data analytics) and how their requirements might influence OpenShift configuration and resource allocation.

###  Real-world Case Studies
Technical Case Studies: Include detailed technical case studies of MPI applications on OpenShift, focusing on the specific challenges and solutions employed.
